# Basic Projects
My first time using Github. Bare with me here.
These are some of my very basic projects I've tried.
<br>These publications are just to document my progress. ^_^

1. **Prime Numbers**. <br>Using a class to find and verify (prime) numbers. A little extra is to also find the nth (input) prime number.
<br> I did also try to improve the program by calculating and saving found prime numbers into a txt file such that the time complexity to get the prime numbers again is O(1) instead. Though this comes with a cost of extra memory growth. (Note I did consider sieve of Eratosthenes, but I opted to not go for that).

<br><br>
2. **Array Sorting and Searching**. <br>Just a collation of some sorting and searching algos I know of. All of them are in-place sortings.

3.1 **Academic Website I**. <br>My first experience making a webpage (aka first time using HTML and CSS). It displays the details of (my) college academic results. The CAP (or GPA) is calculated and shown on the bottom right and it (normally) allows user to add/remove a module from the list. However, I could only make it work on a local server (so putting on github as it is will create errors). I might eventually publish a working one that allows other users to download and customise their own csv (on their local device).  

3.2 **Academic Website II**. <br>A slight touch-up on the "Academic Website I". Additional features include adding and removing modules (row). It utilizes the "localStorage" to store data instead of hard-lockinng it behind a csv file online. This allows other users to save their own module details on their own devices (only tested on windows chrome). Might further consider improvements toward this.

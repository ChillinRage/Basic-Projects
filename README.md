# Basic Projects
My first time using Github. Bare with me here.
These are some of my very basic projects I've tried.
<br>These publications are just to document my progress. ^_^

<br><br>
1. Prime Numbers. <br>Using a class to find and verify (prime) numbers. A little extra is to also find the nth (input) prime number.
<br> I did also try to improve the program by calculating and saving found prime numbers into a txt file such that the time complexity to get the prime numbers again is O(1) instead. Though this comes with a cost of extra memory growth. (Note I did consider sieve of Eratosthenes, but I opted to not go for that).

2. Array Sorting and Searching. <br>\tJust a collation of some sorting and searching algos I know of. All of them are in-place sortings.

3. Academic Website I.
